his powerpoints are very helpful both during class and in review tough but fair grader on homework his failing sense of humor is hilarious
professor wiggins can be monotonous in class but the material is well conveyed the cogas project is pretty cool but involves some work applied thermodynamics is pretty cool and quite relevant to marine applications
steeeeel
his powerpoints say it all the man loves his steel but loves his thermo even more
he sure loves his thermo thats three exclamation points by the way
can be very boring but can also be a very effective professor try to get past the nose hair
i only took the thermodynamics class online since i was studying abroad he was very accepting of the scheduling differences and was quick to respond when i had a question his lectures are very clear and easy to follow you will leave his class with a good understanding of the material

he skips the basics to go straight to the frontier of the field as he calls it he explains things like you already know the subject and does not make it clear at all half of the class time is the students attempting to solve problems that he only talked about vaguely for 10 minutes theres no written exams; he has an oral final and midterm
dr henry if you are such a great professor why you do not teach in a better university where majority is citizen students at npu are all 100% internationals who are making barely ends meet working after school those who get a from him are well-off students who do not work anywhere and get money from their mommies shame on you both
the most uncooperative professor and very hard not recommended his class
worst professor i have ever seen in my entire life
to be fair if you do your part as a normal student should do he is not tough at all to whom rating him badly it is probably you never study and not willing to spend time on the course i would recommend his classes to who has strong self-motivation and actually wanting to learn stuff be prepare to do some reading and googling :
i wo not take his class again

prof werner is one of the best professors at webb he can teach a wide variety of courses and does well with everything he teaches his lectures are always perfectly clear he is an engaging professor who really knows how to keep students interested
a tough grader but very charismatic and easy to listen to in lectures he is very helpful overall and makes the class feel worthwhile
prof werner is also webbs academic dean he is a great professor who always keeps class entertaining and interesting
one of the best professors in the school liked by almost every student reasonable stern but understanding he will make you work for your grade but you  will understand the material better than you thought
an excellent clear and interesting professor being the type of student who has a tendency to zone out or fall asleep in class i have never had a problem paying attention in his class hes very sarcastic and hes always cracking jokes also: as a webb alum he definitely understands how things work here totally one of my favorite profs
professor werner is an awesome guy as well as an amazing instructor he is extremely knowledgeable and is always willing to help if you are having trouble
professor werner is the most engaging professor i have had he presents his lectures with humor but direction the result is the large amounts of learning taken in without being put to sleep i can say werner has made me excited about topics that i otherwise would have loathed he also challenges you with high expectations
no comment

great lecturer encourages in class discussion
exceptional lecturer hilarious in class and a great teacher in general fairly tough class es though
has lots of industry experience and shares it in the classroom tough grader who makes you focus on format if its not good enough to had to a future employer he will take off points really cares about the students and ensuring that they learn the material
-
i will say she is great professor much material is covered at a brisk pace if you ask for help outside of class you will receive it review your notes they do make sense when examined at your own pace rather than the quick pace in class
people either like this teacher or dislike her greatly her accent is thick and the way she teaches concepts is quite confusing i felt confident about my math skills until i met her good luck
teaching style and accent take some getting used to but once you can understand her shes a great professor shes great one-on-one and is more than willing to help when you ca not understand something she talks and works quickly so you will learn a lot of material but be ready for lots of homework
her teaching is nigh incomprehensible she is disorganized and generally not accesible or helpful
you cant understand her
get you mechanical pencils started prof goloubevas classes were nonstop math but boy do you cover a lot of material i learned a bunch about calculus and more importantly how to really crank out homework and study efficiently quite a fulfilling course to look back on
prof goloubevas class can be daunting and hard to follow at times but she is always there to clarify any issues her grading is rough but fair there is no doubt you will leave this class with a clear understanding of the course material
in retrospect a really fantastic prof very tough giving a very rigorous course but i would be lying if i said i didnt learn an incredible amount from her expect loads of homework and tough tests though
teaching style takes a little getting used to but soon enough you pick up on it better be prepared to work hard but in the long run you learn a lot
absolutely fantastic unique teaching style that is very effective there is no doubt that you will learn during this course will stay late to answer any question genuinely concerned about her students understanding the material
prof goloubeva requires effort to pass this course moves extremely quickly and attendance is a must material is covered in depth with mandatory homework every class period professor goloubeva is available every day after class and will work with you until you understand the subject matter great professor overall
the class is tough but the professor is a lot of help and is very willing to work with students to ensure their success
this woman is a national treasure
professor goloubeva is a tough professor but if you work hard you can definitely make it through you can speak to her outside of class and she is willing to help you if you are struggling
prof goulobevas math classes are the most terrifying and rewarding classes i have ever taken homework is assigned very frequently participation in class is a must and tests and quizzes are challenging while her english is not always the clearest and she moves very fast in class her learn-or-die approach will ensure you  will learn calculus
excellent and extremely helpful
she is very demanding but is always happy to help
best math teacher i have ever had she is very difficult but you know the material inside and out when you are done
professor goloubeva is an excellent teacher her teaching style is nontraditional but learning the material is as easy as ever
this teacher is one of the best professors at the school expect to work hard
professor goloubeva is a very nice lady but that does not stop her from pushing every student to the breaking point this is one instructor that will ensure you know all the required material for the course and is more than willing to help you get there
professor goloubeva is one of my favorite professors at webb she is always available for extra-help and takes her time outside of class to patiently explain anything you might not understand homework is due every class but if you take your time to actually do the homework properly you will learn a lot
dr qin a berkley graduate is one of the best professors and mentors i have ever met his style of teaching is so simple yet so intriguing he holds the capability to generate the interest in any student and best of all without pushing the student too much
