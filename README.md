# EECS 486 Final Project, HOT OR NOT

In this project, we scraped http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ and created a machine learning system to predict a reviewer’s rating for any given professor based on the reviewer’s comments, as well as the average score for any professor based on their reviews. We used two different datasets, one based on small schools, and one based on the University of Michigan. For the small schools dataset, we were able to obtain a accuracy of 84% for the professors and 90% for the individual reviews. For the large dataset, we were able to produce accuracies of 72% and 79% for professors and reviews, respectively. 

## Submission Contents

This submission contains the following files:

* liblinear
* opinionfinder
* speciteller

### Necessary Protocols

In order to run in CAEN, you first must install liblinear, which is used in the speciteller program. First, ensure that your liblinear/python/ directory contains a file called "liblinear.so.3". If not, run make in the liblinear/python directory. After this, run "pip install liblinear". 


## Running Program

For running the program, there are two different ways to run it- with webscrapping, and without. 

```
$ 
```

To run the same program with different implementations (e.g. remove stopwords), add the following optional command line arguments

**Remove stopwords**
```
$ 
```

**Stem words**
```
$ 
```

**Remove stopwords and stem words**
```
$ 
```


**NOTE: in order to .**
