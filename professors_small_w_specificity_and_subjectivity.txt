You can speak to her outside of class, and she is willing to help you if you're struggling. Professor Goloubeva is a very nice lady, but that does not stop her from pushing every student to the breaking point. This is one instructor that will ensure you know all the required material for the course and is more than willing to help you get there. Prof Goulobeva's math classes are the most terrifying and rewarding classes I have ever taken. Homework is assigned very frequently, participation in class is a must, and tests and quizzes are challenging. While her English isn't always the clearest and she moves very fast in class, her learn-or-die approach will ensure you'll learn calculus. Professor Goloubeva is one of my favorite professors at Webb. She is always available for extra-help and takes her time outside of class to patiently explain anything you might not understand. Homework is due every class, but if you take your time to actually do the homework properly, you will learn a lot. This teacher is one of the best professors at the school, expect to work hard. Professor Goloubeva is an excellent teacher. Her teaching style is nontraditional, but learning the material is as easy as ever. Best math teacher I have ever had. She is very difficult but you know the material inside and out when you are done. She is very demanding but is always happy to help. Excellent and extremely helpful. This woman is a national treasure. The class is tough, but the professor is a lot of help, and is very willing to work with students to ensure their success. Prof Goloubeva requires effort to pass. This course moves extremely quickly and attendance is a must. Material is covered in depth with mandatory homework every class period. Professor Goloubeva is available every day after class and will work with you until you understand the subject matter. Great Professor overall. Prof. Goloubeva's class can be daunting and hard to follow at times, but she is always there to clarify any issues. Her grading is rough but fair. There is no doubt you will leave this class with a clear understanding of the course material. in retrospect, a really fantastic prof. Very tough, giving a very rigorous course, but i'd be lying if i said I didnt learn an incredible amount from her. Expect loads of homework, and tough tests, though. Teaching style and accent take some getting used to, but once you can understand her, she's a great professor. She's great one-on-one and is more than willing to help when you can't understand something. She talks and works quickly so you will learn a lot of material, but be ready for lots of homework. People either like this teacher or dislike her greatly. Her accent is thick and the way she teaches concepts is quite confusing. I felt confident about my math skills until I met her. Good Luck! I will say she is great professor. Much material is covered at a brisk pace. If you ask for help outside of class, you will receive it. Review your notes, they do make sense when examined at your own pace rather than the quick pace in class. Absolutely fantastic. Unique teaching style that is very effective. there is no doubt that you will learn during this course. Will stay late to answer any question. Genuinely concerned about her students understanding the material. Teaching style takes a little getting used to, but soon enough you pick up on it. Better be prepared to work hard, but in the long run you learn a lot! Get you mechanical pencils started! Prof Goloubeva's classes were nonstop math but boy do you cover a lot of material.

He is a great professor, and his class should kept for the coming semesters also. Prof. Jag is one of the very best and best in the area he teaches. He is expert in the field and his passion for teaching really helps. It is always good to learn under prof.jags, because his teaching methods are more practical and class rooms are always more lively with his lecture. One of my friend suggested that I should take Jag\'s class. Actually I will be graduate this semester and this class is not in my study plan, so I audit it. I really like his class right now. He makes everything so easy for us and explains codes clearly. Prof Vasudevamurthy has immense knowledge of the subject , his effective and simple methods of teaching can give a boost to ones knowledge . He is a great professor who makes the basic concepts clear and has an in depth understanding of the subject at hand.Provides with real time examples that makes learning easy.Makes the class interactive.Encourages doubts & makes us understand till we understand & have it clear in mind.Smart & Joyous. I learned so many cool facts from him and encourage anyone from ANY major to take his class. He\'ll make you rethink your major. He has the a best teaching ability and one of the best professor i ever met. Mr Jagdeesh is an exceptional professor with an amazing clarity of concepts with an unprecendented way of the communicating his concepts across to his students. His uncanny ability to grip the attention of students makes him one of the most sought after professors. It has been a priviledge to have learnt something from such an Industry veteran.Best ', 'num_obj': 451, 'school': 'Northwestern Polytechnic University', 'name': 'Jagadeesh Vasudevamurthy', 'num_subj': 252,
