professor goloubeva is a tough professor but if you work hard you can definitely make it through you can speak to her outside of class and she is willing to help you if you are struggling professor goloubeva is a very nice lady but that does not stop her from pushing every student to the breaking point this is one instructor that will ensure you know all the required material for the course and is more than willing to help you get there prof goulobevas math classes are the most terrifying and rewarding classes i have ever taken homework is assigned very frequently participation in class is a must and tests and quizzes are challenging while her english is not always the clearest and she moves very fast in class her learn-or-die approach will ensure you  will learn calculus professor goloubeva is one of my favorite professors at webb she is always available for extra-help and takes her time outside of class to patiently explain anything you might not understand homework is due every class but if you take your time to actually do the homework properly you will learn a lot this teacher is one of the best professors at the school expect to work hard professor goloubeva is an excellent teacher her teaching style is nontraditional but learning the material is as easy as ever best math teacher i have ever had she is very difficult but you know the material inside and out when you are done she is very demanding but is always happy to help excellent and extremely helpful this woman is a national treasure the class is tough but the professor is a lot of help and is very willing to work with students to ensure their success prof goloubeva requires effort to pass this course moves extremely quickly and attendance is a must material is covered in depth with mandatory homework every class period professor goloubeva is available every day after class and will work with you until you understand the subject matter great professor overall prof goloubevas class can be daunting and hard to follow at times but she is always there to clarify any issues her grading is rough but fair there is no doubt you will leave this class with a clear understanding of the course material in retrospect a really fantastic prof very tough giving a very rigorous course but i would be lying if i said i didnt learn an incredible amount from her expect loads of homework and tough tests though teaching style and accent take some getting used to but once you can understand her shes a great professor shes great one-on-one and is more than willing to help when you ca not understand something she talks and works quickly so you will learn a lot of material but be ready for lots of homework people either like this teacher or dislike her greatly her accent is thick and the way she teaches concepts is quite confusing i felt confident about my math skills until i met her good luck i will say she is great professor much material is covered at a brisk pace if you ask for help outside of class you will receive it review your notes they do make sense when examined at your own pace rather than the quick pace in class absolutely fantastic unique teaching style that is very effective there is no doubt that you will learn during this course will stay late to answer any question genuinely concerned about her students understanding the material teaching style takes a little getting used to but soon enough you pick up on it better be prepared to work hard but in the long run you learn a lot get you mechanical pencils started prof goloubevas classes were nonstop math but boy do you cover a lot of material i learned a bunch about calculus and more importantly how to really crank out homework and study efficiently quite a fulfilling course to look back on you cant understand her - her teaching is nigh incomprehensible she is disorganized and generally not accesible or helpful

students to learn class covers algorithms well and is also a good review of c++ i have taken this course-- digital logic design using verilog summer 2012 ucsc extension in silicon valley ca-- which lays down a solid foundation for basic concepts ideas of both digital logic design and the verilog coding this instructor is very sincere and professinal in teaching hence the end results were very fruitful and effective effective efficient experienced knowledge organized; i learn more i attended digital logic design using verilog on summer 2012 at ucsc extension in silicon valley ca professor vasudevamurthy taught not only the verilog language but also the principal behind it he liked to use simple examples to show some very smart design ideas it is the most interesting class i have ever attended digital logic design using verilog summer 2012 ucsc extension in silicon valley ca dr vasudevamurthy is very knowledgeable of the topics from both industry and academic points of view his own lecture materials are full of examples and exercises he teaches not only the knowledge itself but also how to solve the problems the content for this course was very lengthy but professor put so many example programs to teach the concepts clearly within the short period even amateur students also can understand the vague concepts in a simple way by his lecture i recommend this professor for basic and deep understanding of c++ concepts c++ ucsd extension summer 2012 prof jag uses wonderful small examples to show why each feature of c++ is needed especially good on classes inheritance virtual methods assignments were fun but mostly covered the early part of the course jag is enthusiastic and fun in class -- always well-prepared and totally on top of the material this course thought basic concepts of c++ and course was very helpful to meprofessor was very passionate and enthusiastic he made sure students understand important concepts c++ programming comprehensive: professor was passionate and wanted to students to learn about computer programming professor was also hard to follow at times because he rapidly changed topics book was only referenced and hw came from lecture notes jag knows the subject well he taught the class with great energy and enthusiasm which made it easier for the students to be involved and learn very passionate about the subject material very clear and helpful instructor c++jag clearly knew the subject matter and really enjoyed communicating it with the class he would constantly stop and ask are you with me if you had any questions he would answer them on the spot his lecture notes / textbook were very clear and i loved how he demonstrated the concepts in class his class was very difficult but rewarding i took the c++ comprehensive class jag can help you understand difficult concepts by explaining step-by-step he is energetic and gets the class involved and active participation he also teaches you the correct way of programming that apply to professional work and interview questions i definitely recommend taking jags c++ class jag can make a very complicated concept very simple with his teaching style after attending his class i was able write programs on verilogwould like to attend his class again jagadeesh is a wonderful professor one can get a very solid foundation on the subject from his lecture he is really energetic and makes the class interesting i really enjoyed his c++ class i would definitely recommend him jag consistently applied the same simple approach to all phases of the class that really helped to sink in the concepts it is useful class he will help build the foundation i tool comprehensive c++ with him and i think if you have some knowledge of c++ this class can really help he teaches some very tips and the class is not boringi recommend him would like to take his class again i took the data structure and algorithms using c++ from ucsc extention its very informative and i learned a lot its not an easy subject but the instructor is very enthusiastic gives very useful examples and makes the class very interesting and enjoyable highly recommended incredibly informative class i took this class just to get a general understanding of what data structures was all about and ended up getting a lot of very useful information thank you i took data structures and algorithms using c++ from jagadeesh he absolutely loves to teach he is a hard teacher but fair i consider him to be one of the best teachers i have ever had he knows the subject matter extremely well and is very

class is fantasticthe professor taught the class from the entry level and he gave a lot of references to students the lectures are very practicalthe textbook is a little hard for students to read by themselvesbut professor made an easy way for students to understand the classafter classstudents can understand the class comprehensively very good professor professsor explains the suject in detaili am happy that i can understand it clearly i was one of the student of prof vasudevamurthy who took verilog hdl & fpga design courses which helped me build a career in vlsi designhis classes are more of a conversation rather than just a lecture involving student-teacher interaction helping them understand the concepts & at the same time implement them -ashhhadmohammed@alcatel-lucentcom he takes a lot of pride in his preparation for each lecture even though this class covered advanced data structures he even taught me a few features of c++ that i never seen before in my introduction to c++ classes i took before in addition he made sure to use the previous data structure classes to build the new ones which impressed me a lot practical course that includes additional c++ practical tricks mastering i took his one course of fpga before last semester and he taught every concept in fpga he is a great professorin current semesteri have one course of ce489he teaches every thing using daily routing example which makes it easy to understand professor jagdeesh vasudevamurthy is extremely talented and excellent in teaching his course material is very helpful he has the ability to teach very
