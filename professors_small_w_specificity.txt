One of the best professors in the school, liked by almost every student, reasonable, stern but understanding. He will make you work for your grade, but you'll understand the material better than you thought. Prof. Werner is one of the best professors at Webb. He can teach a wide variety of courses, and does well with everything he teaches. His lectures are always perfectly clear. He is an engaging professor who really knows how to keep students interested. Professor Werner is the most engaging professor I have had. He presents his lectures with humor but direction. The result is the large amounts of learning taken in without being put to sleep. I can say Werner has made me excited about topics that I otherwise would have loathed. He also challenges you with high expectations. A tough grader, but very charismatic and easy to listen to in lectures. He is very helpful overall, and makes the class feel worthwhile. Great lecturer encourages in class discussion. Prof. Werner is also Webb's academic dean. He is a great professor who always keeps class entertaining and interesting. He is a very good teacher and really knows his stuff. He's always making jokes and as a Webb alum, he knows what's going on. No Comment An excellent, clear, and interesting professor. Being the type of student who has a tendency to zone out or fall asleep in class, I've never had a problem paying attention in his class. He's very sarcastic, and he's always cracking jokes. Also: as a Webb alum he definitely understands how things work here. Totally one of my favorite profs. ", 'school': 'Webb Institute', 'name': 'Matthew Werner',

	{'all_reviews': "Professor Goloubeva is a tough professor, but if you work hard, you can definitely make it through. You can speak to her outside of class, and she is willing to help you if you're struggling. Professor Goloubeva is a very nice lady, but that does not stop her from pushing every student to the breaking point. This is one instructor that will ensure you know all the required material for the course and is more than willing to help you get there. Prof Goulobeva's math classes are the most terrifying and rewarding classes I have ever taken. Homework is assigned very frequently, participation in class is a must, and tests and quizzes are challenging. While her English isn't always the clearest and she moves very fast in class, her learn-or-die approach will ensure you'll learn calculus. Professor Goloubeva is one of my favorite professors at Webb. She is always available for extra-help and takes her time outside of class to patiently explain anything you might not understand. Homework is due every class, but if you take your time to actually do the homework properly, you will learn a lot. This teacher is one of the best professors at the school, expect to work hard. Professor Goloubeva is an excellent teacher. Her teaching style is nontraditional, but learning the material is as easy as ever. Best math teacher I have ever had. She is very difficult but you know the material inside and out when you are done. She is very demanding but is always happy to help. Excellent and extremely helpful. This woman is a national treasure. The class is tough, but the professor is a lot of help, and is very willing to work with students to ensure their success. Prof Goloubeva requires effort to pass. This course moves extremely quickly and attendance is a must. Material is covered in depth with mandatory homework every class period. Professor Goloubeva is available every day after class and will work with you until you understand the subject matter. Great Professor overall. Prof. Goloubeva's class can be daunting and hard to follow at times, but she is always there to clarify any issues. Her grading is rough but fair. There is no doubt you will leave this class with a clear understanding of the course material. in retrospect, a really fantastic prof. Very tough, giving a very rigorous course, but i'd be lying if i said I didnt learn an incredible amount from her. Expect loads of homework, and tough tests, though. Teaching style and accent take some getting used to, but once you can understand her, she's a great professor. She's great one-on-one and is more than willing to help when you can't understand something. She talks and works quickly so you will learn a lot of material, but be ready for lots of homework. People either like this teacher or dislike her greatly. Her accent is thick and the way she teaches concepts is quite confusing. I felt confident about my math skills until I met her. Good Luck! I will say she is great professor. Much material is covered at a brisk pace. If you ask for help outside of class, you will receive it. Review your notes, they do make sense when examined at your own pace rather than the quick pace in class. Absolutely fantastic. Unique teaching style that is very effective. there is no doubt that you will learn during this course. Will stay late to answer any question. Genuinely concerned about her students understanding the material. Teaching style takes a little getting used to, but soon enough you pick up on it. Better be prepared to work hard, but in the long run you learn a lot! Get you mechanical pencils started! Prof Goloubeva's classes were nonstop math but boy do you cover a lot of material. I learned a bunch about calculus and more importantly how to really crank out homework and study efficiently. Quite a fulfilling course to look back on. you cant understand her. - Her teaching is nigh incomprehensible, she is disorganized and generally not accesible or helpful ", 'school': 'Webb Institute', 'name': 'Elena Goloubeva',

His course materials are very well prepared and the homework he assigns are extremely useful. Very passionate in his teaching. I strongly recommend this class to anyone who wants to expose to professional C++ programming for real life problems. He is a great professor who makes the basic concepts clear and has an in depth understanding of the subject at hand.Provides with real time examples that makes learning easy.Makes the class interactive.The course material is extremely useful and better than text books. One of the best instructors. His teaching style is very practical and hands-on. He provides excellent examples and design techniques to make concepts easier to understand. He has a vast knowledge of the field and connects course material to real world situations, which makes attending his class very worthwhile. He is one of my great instructor. His text book is extremely clear. I think his handout materials are better than any textbook because they are much easier to understand and including many good examples. His teaching method is very practical. I\'d like to take another course with him, again. Excellent teaching skills. Professor\'s vast knowledge of the subject helps a lot. Materials used in the class are easy to understand. Great instructor. His handout materials are extremely clear. I think his handout materials are better than any textbook because they are much easier to understand and including many good examples.I will take his FPGA course next semester.I also think his teaching method is very practical, gives student good concept about engineering field. Great instructor. His handout materials are extremely clear. I think his handout materials are better than any textbook because they are much easier to understand and including many good examples.I will take his FPGA course in next semester.I also think his teaching method is very practical, gives student good concept about engineering field. his real world experience is his USP. His material and pin pointed examples directed at industry related problems make his class a must attend .Things would be better is Dr.Jagadeesh encourages more classroom participation and short tests just to keep concepts fresh. Provides very nice examples and a set of industry standard libraries and practical design techniques. Very hands-on way of teaching He is one of the Best Professors at NPU. one of my friend suggested me to take his class. he gives importance on making concepts clear..not just like conventional theory classes. his lectures ware more based on field applications and examples that?s really nice and interesting and more inter-active.i am looking forward to take his classes. Mr. Jagadeesh vasudev murthy is a very good professor who teaches with practical knowledge.. The way he teached was very practical, however I needed more time to digest codes to me. Overall, he is the one of best instructor ever have. The way he teached us very practical, however I needed little time more to digest codes, it\'s just 10 sessions. Overall, he is the one of best instructor. Professor is very kind and his way of teaching is very fantastic and for a day at least he tells 1 or more interview questions which are frequently asked and the environment he creates in the class is simply superb he always starts from the beginning of the basics which is very useful in our future life and he is always friendly with us Very practical. good professor nice class I recommand to other students Its very usefull class and professor is really good. its really useful class This Professor is the best professor i have ever seen in my whole educational career.Any one who has no prior knowledge of the subject can also understand his lecture.I have been in his class since last 3 semesters and not even a single class I missed.I love his lectures and he is the best. Professor Dr. Vasudevamurthy is one of the best professors i have ever had. The intention of the professor is what impresses me. He doesn\'t mind repeating a topic again and again and again till we get the concept. It\'s very hard to find professors who are this much dedicated and caring to explain. He made FPFA much easier and interesting. amazing class The class is fantastic.The professor taught the class from the entry level, and he gave a lot of references to students. The lectures are very practical.The textbook is a little hard for students to read by themselves,but professor made an easy way for students to understand the class.After class,students can understand the class comprehensively. Very good professor Professsor explains the suject in detail.I am happy that i can understand it clearly. I was one of the student of Prof. Vasudevamurthy who took Verilog HDL & FPGA design courses which helped me build a career in VLSI design.His classes are more of a conversation rather than just a lecture involving student-teacher interaction helping them understand the concepts & at the same time implement them. -ashhhad.mohammed@alcatel-lucent.com He takes a lot of pride in his preparation for each lecture. Even though this class covered advanced data structures, he even taught me a few features of C++ that I never seen before in my introduction to C++ classes I took before. In addition, he made sure to use the previous data structure classes to build the new ones which impressed me a lot! Practical course that includes additional C++ practical tricks mastering. I took his one course of FPGA before last semester and he taught every concept in FPGA .He is a great professor.In current semester,I have one course of CE489.he teaches every thing using daily routing example which makes it easy to understand. Professor Jagdeesh Vasudevamurthy is extremely talented and excellent in teaching. His course material is very helpful. He has the ability to teach very complicated concepts in a simple manner that is difficult to forget. I strongly recommend this professor. He is a great professor, and his class should kept for the coming semesters also. Prof. Jag is one of the very best and best in the area he teaches. He is expert in the field and his passion for teaching really helps. It is always good to learn under prof.jags, because his teaching methods are more practical and class rooms are always more lively with his lecture. One of my friend suggested that I should take Jag\'s class. Actually I will be graduate this semester and this class is not in my study plan, so I audit it. I really like his class right now. He makes everything so easy for us and explains codes clearly. Prof Vasudevamurthy has immense knowledge of the subject , his effective and simple methods of teaching can give a boost to ones knowledge . He is a great professor who makes the basic concepts clear and has an in depth understanding of the subject at hand.Provides with real time examples that makes learning easy.Makes the class interactive.Encourages doubts & makes us understand till we understand & have it clear in mind.Smart & Joyous. I learned so many cool facts from him and encourage anyone from ANY major to take his class. He\'ll make you rethink your major. He has the a best teaching ability and one of the best professor i ever met. Mr Jagdeesh is an exceptional professor with an amazing clarity of concepts with an unprecendented way of the communicating his concepts across to his students. His uncanny ability to grip the attention of students makes him one of the most sought after professors. It has been a priviledge to have learnt something from such an Industry veteran.Best ', 'school': 'Northwestern Polytechnic University', 'name': 'Jagadeesh Vasudevamurthy',
